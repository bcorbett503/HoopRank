            <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 15, 2026</p>

            <p>Welcome to HoopRank. These Terms &amp; Conditions ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the HoopRank

            <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
            <p>You must be at least 13 years of age to create an account or use the App. If you are under 18, you

            <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account at any time, with or without cause, and with or
                without notice.</p>

            <h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>
            <p>You agree not to use the App to:</p>

                <li>Violate any applicable local, state, national, or international law</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We reserve the right to remove any content and suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms, at
                our sole discretion.</p>

            <h2>4. User Content</h2>
            <h3>4.1 Your Content</h3>
            <p>You retain ownership of the content you create and submit through the App, including status posts,
                comments, profile information, and uploaded images ("User Content"). By submitting User Content, you
                grant HoopRank a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable license to use, reproduce,
                modify, display, and distribute your User Content in connection with operating and improving the App.
            </p>

            <h3>4.2 Content Standards</h3>
            <p>You are solely responsible for your User Content. You represent and warrant that your User Content does
                not violate any third party's intellectual property rights, rights of privacy or publicity, or any
                applicable law.</p>

            <h3>4.3 Content Removal</h3>
            <p>We may remove any User Content at any time and for any reason, including content that we believe violates
                these Terms or is otherwise objectionable.</p>

            <h2>5. Rankings and Ratings</h2>
            <div class="important">
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> HoopRank ratings and rankings (including the "HoopRank" ELO-based score)
                    are calculated algorithmically based on match results reported within the App. These ratings are for
                    entertainment and recreational purposes only. They are not an official measure of athletic ability,
                    and HoopRank makes no representations about the accuracy or completeness of any ranking or rating.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>Match results must be honestly and accurately reported. Intentional misreporting of scores constitutes a
                violation of these Terms and may result in account suspension or termination.</p>

            <h2>6. Court and Venue Information</h2>
            <p>The App displays information about basketball courts and venues sourced from public data and third-party
                services. While we strive for accuracy, we do not guarantee that court information (including locations,
                availability, hours of operation, or court conditions) is accurate, complete, or current. Use of any
                venue is at your own risk, and you should verify facility details independently.</p>

            <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>The App, including its design, features, algorithms, software, graphics, trademarks, and all other
                proprietary content, is owned by HoopRank and is protected by copyright, trademark, and other
                intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or create derivative works based
                on the App or its content without our prior written consent.</p>

            <h2>8. Privacy</h2>
            <p>Your use of the App is also governed by our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, which describes how we
                collect, use, and protect your personal information. By using the App, you consent to the practices
                described in our Privacy Policy.</p>

            <h2>9. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>The App may contain links to or integrate with third-party services (including Apple Sign-In, Google
                Sign-In, and Google Maps). We are not responsible for the content, privacy practices, or terms of
                service of any third-party services. Your use of third-party services is governed by their respective
                terms and policies.</p>

            <h2>10. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
            <div class="important">
                <p><strong>THE APP IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND,

                    disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of
                    merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. We do not warrant
                    that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or free of viruses or other harmful
                    components.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>

                    DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OR AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
                    CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES</strong>, including but not limited to loss of profits, data,
                use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, arising out of or in connection with:</p>

                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>In no event shall our total liability to you for all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or
                the App exceed the amount you have paid to HoopRank in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim, or
                fifty dollars ($50), whichever is greater.</p>

            <h2>12. Indemnification</h2>
            <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless HoopRank, its officers, directors, employees, agents,

            <h3>13.1 Binding Arbitration</h3>
            <p>Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the App shall be resolved
                through binding individual arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA")
                under its Consumer Arbitration Rules. The arbitration shall take place in the State of California (or
                remotely, at the arbitrator's discretion). The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding.</p>

            <h3>13.2 Class Action Waiver</h3>
            <p><strong>YOU AND HOOPRANK AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS
                    INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR
                    REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.</strong> The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims and
                may not preside over any form of class or representative proceeding.</p>

            <h3>13.3 Small Claims Exception</h3>
            <p>Notwithstanding the above, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court for disputes
                within the court's jurisdiction.</p>

            <h2>14. Governing Law</h2>
            <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California,
                United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

            <h2>15. Termination</h2>
            <p>We may terminate or suspend your account and access to the App immediately, without prior notice or
                liability, for any reason, including if you breach these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the
                App will immediately cease. Sections 4, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 shall survive any termination of these
                Terms.</p>

            <h2>16. Severability</h2>
            <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the remaining
                provisions shall continue in full force and effect.</p>

            <h2>17. Entire Agreement</h2>
            <p>These Terms, together with our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, constitute the entire agreement
                between you and HoopRank regarding your use of the App and supersede all prior agreements and
                understandings.</p>

            <h2>18. Changes to These Terms</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify you of material changes by posting
                the updated Terms within the App and updating the "Effective Date" above. Your continued use of the App
                after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
